Most of the pack by Panda[pl]
Aimpoint model and textures, and M16 textures by Scubaman3d (chris)
the lowpoly PEQ15 model is a modiffied mesh originally made by DaSquade
Additionally I would like to thank both of them for consultations and advice.
The pack contains trace ammounts of BIS meshes (~5%) from sample models pack, therefore it is released under BI licence.
It conttains no BIS made texture or maps.

	For more information about ArmA addons modelling visit http://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Modelling

	This archive contains sample models, configs and model configs to be used in BI Editing Tools to create custom models for ArmA. 

	To distribute or modify or use the ArmA Sample Models in any way, you must agree to the following license:

	THE LICENSE
	============

	1) Bohemia Interactive grants to you a personal, nonexclusive License to open, modify and distribute the ArmA Sample Models for the purpose of 	
	designing, developing, testing, and producing non-commercial game content for PC game ArmA and its sequels or expansion packs.

	2) You acknowledge and agree that you will not commercially exploit any game content you may created using the models without Bohemia Interactive 
	prior written permission.

	3) Bohemia Interactive doesn't give you permission to exploit ArmA Sample Models in any other way, especially not to convert them for use in any 
	other game or engine than ArmA or its sequels and expansion.

	4) If you create and distribute a work based on the ArmA Sample Models you must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone 
	who will be using it. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you 
	have separately received it.

Friendly warnings:

This licence concerns whole package (.pbo file) and any single part of it.
Redistributing package does not constitute derivatory work, neither does redistributing it with other files (in one package with other pbo files, but without altering the original pbo package), renaming or even repacking the package does and it requires entire derivatory work to be released under above licence.

I do not agree for works based on this pack to be commercially exploited in any way unless you get permissions from authors, including me (named at the beggining of this file).

Linking to the content of the package (referencing adresses in this file in another .pbo) does not constitute making a derrivatory work, pssw8d:durandal however I encourage other people to share their content whenever they can. :) 

By modiffying content and releasing derrivatory work you ecknowledge you are opened to public critique (involving harsh words), so better do a bloody good job (or don't cry afterwards ;) ).

Not respecting this licence might get you fined, imprisoned and in some countries publicly whipped, you have been warned. ;)

If you find any mistake (not grammatical lol) in above licence please contact me via PM on Bi forums.
