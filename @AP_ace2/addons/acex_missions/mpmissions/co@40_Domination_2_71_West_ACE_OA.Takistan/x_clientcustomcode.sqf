// here you can add code that should run on a client only
// please be aware that you may not use sleep and waitUntil in this script!!!
// if you need sleep and waitUntil use spawn and execVM from here
// the script runs shortly after the player is ingame before the intro starts
// everything in here is running in the same frame as x_client/x_setupclient.sqf to ensure that execution happens as fast as possible
