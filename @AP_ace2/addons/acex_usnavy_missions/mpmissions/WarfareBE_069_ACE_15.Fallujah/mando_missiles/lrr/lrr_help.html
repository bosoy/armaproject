<h2>
<p>
By default, the radar of the SAM site is turned off and the display will not show any contacts. If the radar is turned on, the display will show contacts within detection range and independetly of the side (stealth units will not be displayed).
<br>
<br>
Initially radar will work in RWS mode and the contacts will be updated slowly. Up to 10 contacts might be displayed simultaneously, but in RWS mode only position is updated.
<br>
<br>
Left clicking with the mouse pointer over a contact marks it as current target and the radar switches to STT mode. In this mode the radar tracks a single target and updates all its data at a higher rate. Speed, distance, altitude over ground, relative altitude between radar and target as well as climbing speed of the target will be displayed. The current direction of the target is displayed as a short line starting from the target's position and heading in target's direction. The selected target will receive a radar lock warning and if the lock is broken because target is out of range, target disturbance of the lock with ECM, or no line of sight between the radar and the target, the radar will switch again to RWS mode. To break the lock and switch back to RWS mode simply left click with the mouse in the radar screen.
<br>
<br>
The upper left corner of the radar display shows information about current mode, current displayed range, max radar range, selected launcher, camera's target and camera's magnification.
<br>
<br>
The lower left corner of the radar display shows information about the list of assigned missile launchers (L1, L2 and L3), indicating its state, whether they are allowed to engage targets or not and missiles left.
<br>
<br>
Friendly fired missiles are displayed as small circles on the radar screen.
<br>
<br>
Use the mouse wheel to adjust the current on-screen visible range.

<br>
<br>
