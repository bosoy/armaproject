// FIRE ON RELOAD !!



// - _dummy fire _weapon
// Should be executed on client where vehicle is local?
// 1. Executing FOR with AI on a client works (when mortar is local to the client)
// 2. Executing FOR with AI on the server, when mortar is local to server does also work but no visual effects (firing sound, muzzleflash)
// Are effects visible for another client when performing step 1?
// - No they are not. An other client does not see firing effects
// - And if the other client who does not see the effects loads mortar, then the client where mortar is local to sees the effects

// Conclusion the firing is only local to the machine where the mortar is local to when using the FIRE command
// It seems not to be broadcasted over net (Arma bug)

// Testing now with USEWEAPON - ACTION command.
// - Tested. UseWeapon could work if the weapon index was known.
// - Since we remove the weapon and add a magazine and re-add the weapon,
//   the weapon index changes everytime, and AI fails to fire then
// Speculative, not really sure

// Probably the index is always 0 because its the only weapon even if re-added?
// - Confirmed

// Executing 
// (vehicle gunner cursorTarget) action ["useweapon",(vehicle cursorTarget),(gunner vehicle cursorTarget),0]
// on a client where the mortar is local, fires only for THAT client, other clients dont see the effects

// But executing it on a client where the mortar is NOT local, then ALL clients see the effects
// So, the firing should be done on any other client where the mortar is not local to

// Called from server Trigger !!!!!!
